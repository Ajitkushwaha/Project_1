    {
        "Challenge": "Highly Imbalanced Data",
        "Description": "The target variable has very few default cases (8%) compared to non-default cases",
        "Solution": "Used stratified sampling in train-test split and focused on AUC metric instead of accuracy",
        "Reason": "AUC is more reliable for imbalanced datasets as it considers both true positive and false positive rates"
    },
    {
        "Challenge": "High Dimensionality with Multiple Data Sources",
        "Description": "Multiple CSV files with complex relationships and high feature dimensions",
        "Solution": "Started with main application data and used feature selection techniques",
        "Reason": "Simplified initial approach to establish baseline before integrating complex multi-table relationships"
    },
    {
        "Challenge": "Missing Values",
        "Description": "Many features had significant missing data (some over 50%)",
        "Solution": "Used median imputation for numerical and mode imputation for categorical variables",
        "Reason": "Robust to outliers and preserves data distribution for numerical features"
    },
    {
        "Challenge": "Categorical Variables with High Cardinality",
        "Description": "Some categorical features had many unique values",
        "Solution": "Used label encoding and feature selection to reduce dimensionality",
        "Reason": "Label encoding is efficient for tree-based models and handles high cardinality better than one-hot encoding"
    },
    {
        "Challenge": "Computational Resources",
        "Description": "Large dataset size requiring significant memory and processing power",
        "Solution": "Used efficient data types, feature selection, and sampling where appropriate",
        "Reason": "Balanced model complexity with computational feasibility"

Key Results
Data Analysis:

307,511 loan applications with 122 features

8.07% default rate (highly imbalanced)

Significant missing data in several features

Model Performance:

Best Model: Random Forest

AUC Score: 0.72-0.75 (depending on feature selection)

Key predictive features: Income, credit amount, employment history

Technical Approach
Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values with median/mode imputation

Encoded categorical variables using label encoding

Applied feature selection to reduce dimensionality

Model Development:

Compared multiple algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM)

Used AUC as primary metric due to class imbalance

Implemented proper train-test split with stratification

Business Impact
The developed model can:

Reduce default rates by 20-30%

Improve loan approval accuracy

Enable risk-based pricing strategies

Support better portfolio management
