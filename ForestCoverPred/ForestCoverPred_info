    #         'Challenge': 'High Dimensionality',
    #         'Description': 'Dataset has 54 features (10 continuous + 44 binary) which can lead to curse of dimensionality',
    #         'Solution': 'Used tree-based models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) that handle high dimensionality well. Considered PCA for visualization but not for modeling to preserve interpretability.',
    #         'Technique': 'Feature importance analysis, Regularization'
    #     },
    #     {
    #         'Challenge': 'Class Imbalance',
    #         'Description': 'Potential imbalance in cover type distribution across different wilderness areas',
    #         'Solution': 'Used stratified sampling in train-test split, class_weight parameter in models, and evaluated using multiple metrics beyond accuracy',

    #     },
    #     {

    #         'Description': '7 different cover types to predict, making it a complex multiclass problem',
    #         'Solution': 'Used algorithms with native multiclass support (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and one-vs-rest approach for others',

    #         'Challenge': 'Computational Complexity',
